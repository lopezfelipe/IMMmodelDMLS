# IsothermMigrationModel

An implementation of the isotherm migration method for heat transfer in spherical coordinates, as proposed by Devesse (JHMT, 2014), to model melting and solidification in the laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process. The model includes only heat transfer, which is modeled with a diffusion equation with temperature-dependent thermal diffusivity. The state vector is given by the half-widths of isotherms corresponding to a user-defined temperature grid.
